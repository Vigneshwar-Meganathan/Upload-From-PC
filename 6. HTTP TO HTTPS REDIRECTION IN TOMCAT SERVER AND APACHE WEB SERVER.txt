HTTP TO HTTPS REDIRECTION IN TOMCAT SERVER:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP:1
   Need to install the SSL certificate on the tomcat server and on the Server.xml file
STEP 2:
   Then need to update the security constraint code the om web.xml file.
   If we are going to run the web application 
   Just go to the web.xml file and paste the below code
      <security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
        <web-resource-name>securedapp</web-resource-name>
        <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <user-data-constraint>
        <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
    </user-data-constraint>
</security-constraint>
   Then export the file .war from eclipse tool and update that war file in tomcat server on webapp file.
   Check the http://localhost:8080 it will redirect to https://localhost:9091

HTTP TO HTTPS REDIRECTION IN APACHE WEB SERVER:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STEP 1:
   INSTALLATION STEPS FOR THE TOMCAT SERVER:
   Download the Apache server from the bellow link:
   https://www.apachelounge.com/download/
   Along with that we to install the compatablity Visual C++ Redistributable for the apache web server its avaible in same above link.
   For the installation process 
   First install the Visual C++ Redistributable  vc_redist_x64.exe
   Second step Extract the Apace web server and locate the path C:/
STEP 2:
   After installation set the environment varialbe for the apcahe web server path C:/Apache24/Bin
   Now just open the command prompt and locate the apcahe web server path on cmd.
   Run the Command httpd -k install (installing the package)
   After the installation successfull go to the service.msc and start the apache24 service.
   Once the service started go to the browser and type just localhost it will diplay "IT WORKS" if we get this display message apache web server is working perfect.
   Then go to config file right click on http.conf file open with notepad++  line 227 ServerName: 127.0.0.1:8081 change to this.
   Refresh the page and check it working or not if we get the display message "IT WORKS" working fine.

STEP 3:
   For enable the https on apache web server need to create or generate the SSL certificate and Private key.
   Just open the command prompt and locate the path C:/Apache24/Bin
   Run the command for generate the SSL certificate and private key: 
   openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 356 -newkey rsa:2048 -out server.crt -keyout server.key
   It will ask the information and enter tha information one by one.
   The certificate and key will generate in bin folder move both file to config folder.
   Now open the http.conf and unmound some command lines 
   Line 176: ssl_module module/mod_ssl.so
   Line 527: Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf
   Line 174: socache_shmcb_module modules/mod_socache_shmcb.so
   Go the extra folder and open the httpd-ssl.conf
   Line 125: ServerName 127.0.0.1:443
   Check the path of the certificate 
   Line 144: Path of the ssl certificate
   Check the path of the private key
   Line 154: Path of hte Private key
   Try to restart the apache24 service and go to browser type https://localhost it will display message "IT WORKS"
STEP 4:
   Now we going to redirect form http to htpps if we hit on http it will redirect to https.
   We to add a rewrite command on http.conf file.
   Command Line:
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
   RewriteRule (.*) https://%{SERVER_NAME} [R,L]
   Now unmound some command lines 
   Line 162: rewrite_module modules /mod_rewrite.so
   Now restart the apache web server go to browser type: http:localhost it will automatically redirect https:localhost.
