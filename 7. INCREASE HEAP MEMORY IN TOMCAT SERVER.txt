INCREASE HEAP MEMORY IN TOMCAT SERVER:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The Tomcat server is works within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
   JVM that controls the amount of memory avaialbe
   Tomcat should be configured to have a maximun java Heap size of atleast 2GB for a testing server, and atleast 4GB for a production server.
   Use of increasing the JVM memory it will speed up the tomcat server 
   
   JVM ALLOCATE MEMORY:
   Java objects reside in an area of memory called the heap.
   Whenever we create an object, it is created in the heap space. Any object created in the heap space has global access and can be referenced from anywhere on the application.
   When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected, and during the garbage collection process, objects that are no longer in use are cleared, thus making space for new objects.
   It identifies which objects are in use and which are not and deleting the unused objects.
   
   INCREASE JVM MEMORY IN TOMCAT SERVER
   Go to the installation path of the tomcat server  path: C:/program files/apache foundation/tomcat9/bin
   There we will find the tomcat9w.exe file right click on that file and select run as administration.
   The 5th tab is the JAVA TAB just click on that 
   Update the setting like below
   Initial memory pool — 1024 MB
   Maximum memory pool — 2048 MB
   Thread stack size — Leave this field empty
   Go to the GENERAL TAB 
   Select STOP service and START the service back.
   Click OK.
   Just go to the tomcat server page right side click on SERVER STATUS
   JVM: 
   Free Momory:it will be increased by 2048mb

   INCREASE JVM MEMORY IN TOMCAT SERVER BY SETENV FILE
   Go to the installation path bin folder create the .txt file 
   Enter the command: set JAVA_OPTS=%JAVA_OPTS% -Xms1024m  -Xmx1024m
   And save as setenv.bat as a batch file.
   Explanation:
   Xms is the inital memory pool
   Xmx is the maximum memory pool
   When setting the Java heap size, you should specify your memory argument using one of the letters "m" or "M" for MB or "g" or "G" for GB.
   Your setting won't work if you specify "MB" or "GB." Valid arguments look like this:
   Xms64m or -Xms64M
   Xmx1g or -Xmx1G
   Xmx and -Xms can be defined in different size such as kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes.
   Xmx2048k
   Xmx1024m
   Xmx2g
   Using -Xmx512m is a valid option, but Xmx0.5g will cause an error.

   Using the command prompt locate the tomcat server bin path and run the batch file and restart the server.
