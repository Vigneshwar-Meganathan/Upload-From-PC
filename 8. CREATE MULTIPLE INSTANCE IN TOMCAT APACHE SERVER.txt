CREATE MULTIPLE INSTANCE IN TOMCAT APACHE SERVER:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   More number of tomcat servers is said to be a clusting.
STEP 1:
   We need to create 3 folders according to the requirements (ex: tomcat1, tomcat2, tomcat3)
   In this path: C:/Program files/Apache foundation/tomcat8
   Then create the enviroment variable set CATALINA_HOME set the path: C:/Program files/Apache foundation/tomcat8
   Inside that 3 folders we need move the folders like conf, log,temp,webapps,work on tomcat1, tomcat2, tomcat3.
   we need to edit the server.xml file and change the http connector port, https port, shutdown port and finally ajp port.
   For Example:
		Port	    Tomcat1		Tomcat2		Tomcat3
      Shutdown		9991		9992		9993
      HTTP			8181		8282		8383	
      HTTPS			8141		8242		8343
      AJP	  		8109		8209		8309
   Like above example we need to update on all 3 tomcat instance

STEP 2:
   Now we need to create the bat file to run the multipe instance tomcat1, tomcat2, tomcat3.
   It should be a seperate bat file for each tomcat server for 1, 2, 3.
   Create the .txt file and enter the below command:
     @echo off
	 set CATALINA_BASE=C:\<"path of the instance">
	 cd "%CATALINA_HOME%\bin"
	 set TITLE=<Name of the tomcat folder>
	 call startup.bat %TITLE%
   Save it and rename this file as startup.bat

  Create the .txt file and enter the below command:
     @echo off
	 set CATALINA_BASE=C:\<"path of the instance">
	 cd "%CATALINA_HOME%\bin"
	 call shutdown.bat %TITLE%	 
   Save it and rename this file as shutdown.bat
   For all 3 tomcat server start the bat file startup.bat and keep it as running.
   Go to the browser and the localhost for all 3 tomcat servers assigned  8181, 8282, 8383.
   Check its working.
